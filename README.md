# People-gather-to-identify-challenge
The impact of the epidemic on people is reflected in all aspects of clothing, food, housing and transportation. In epidemic prevention and control, it is necessary to reduce unnecessary cluster activities and reduce the number of people participating in cluster activities. For individuals, try not to go to crowded places, especially closed places.  In this competition, we need contestants to develop an algorithm model to identify the number of people in the figure. In order to simplify the difficulty of the competition, we only need the players to identify the number of people, and do not need to predict the position of pedestrians.
